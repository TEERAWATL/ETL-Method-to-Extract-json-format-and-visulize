# ETL-Method-to-Extract-json-format-and-visulize

This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Python using a JSON data source. It uses pandas for data transformation and manipulation and Plotly for data visualization.

Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the project in a Jupyter Notebook.

You will need to have the following packages installed:

-pandas 
-plotly

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the ETL process and a JSON file containing the data.

ETL_method_from_JSON_format.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the ETL process, which reads data from a JSON file, transforms it, and visualizes it using a bar chart.

names.json: A JSON file containing sample data.
